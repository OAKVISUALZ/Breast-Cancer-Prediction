# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting breast cancer types (malignant or benign) using a logistic regression model. Leveraging a dataset from scikit-learn, it provides an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights into model performance. The primary goal is to assist early detection and diagnosis, improving patient outcomes.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Imports the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles dataset exploration and prepares data for training.
- **Model Training**: Implements logistic regression for classification.
- **Evaluation**: Computes accuracy metrics to measure model performance.
- **Results Visualization**: Includes summary statistics and performance metrics.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `NumPy` for numerical computations
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models and evaluation metrics

---

## Dataset Information

- **Source**: The dataset is sourced from scikit-learn's built-in datasets.
- **Description**: Contains 569 samples of breast tumor features, classified as either malignant (0) or benign (1).
- **Features**: 30 numerical features such as `mean radius`, `mean texture`, `mean smoothness`, etc.
- **Target Variable**: `target` (0 = malignant, 1 = benign)
